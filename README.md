## About this project
The goal of this project was to learn mysql and make a GUI application that interfaces with a mysql database.
The database represents Formula 1 seasons and Drivers' Championships.
There are 7 tables in the database.
The program contains the following features:
>* Displaying all tables ✔
>* Modifying records in all tables ✔
>* Inserting records into all tables ✔
>* Deleting records from all tables ✔
>* Three special querries at the top of the page ✔
>* Exporting the tables as .CSV files ✔

Also this project uses PHP 8 so you will need that if you want to try it out 😉
